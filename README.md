# PokemonBattlerBot
Package runs with Python3 

# Required Packages
Install requests, docopt, websockets, and aiohttp. Sample command

pip3 install --user requests 

# MacOS Notes
If you have an SSL certification error with Python3 on Mac, you can fix it with 
the following command

# Accounts
I believe you have to make an account before you start testing with the bot. I 
recommend making the accounts in a way that the user name matches the password.
